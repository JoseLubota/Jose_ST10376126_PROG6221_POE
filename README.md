# Changes made based on feedback 

My Lecturer identified that my code was well written but there was left space for improvement in my ReadMe file. 
He suggested that I should more details in the file regarding the steps from downloading until using the application,
and I implemented it, as a bonus the user will also the able to download a guide since the application became more complex with 
the new updates.
